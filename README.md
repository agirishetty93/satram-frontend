# GitHub Copilot Coding Agent — How It Works

When you ask the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to make changes, it **never commits directly to your `main` branch**. Here is exactly what happens every time:

1. **A new branch is created automatically** — the agent always works on a dedicated branch with a name like `copilot/<short-description>` (for example, `copilot/add-info-on-branch-usage`).
2. **All code changes go to that branch** — your `main` branch is untouched.
3. **A Pull Request (PR) is opened** — the agent opens a PR from its branch targeting `main`. You can review every change line-by-line in the PR before anything is merged.
4. **You decide what gets merged** — only after you approve and merge the PR will any change reach `main`. You can also close the PR without merging if you don't like the result.

### Protecting `main` with branch protection rules (recommended)

For extra safety you can configure GitHub branch protection rules so that no one (not even repository admins) can push directly to `main`:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub → **Settings** → **Branches**.
2. Click **Add branch ruleset** (or **Add rule** for the classic interface).
3. Set the branch name pattern to `main`.
4. Enable **Require a pull request before merging** and optionally **Require approvals**.
5. Click **Save changes**.

With these rules in place, merging a PR is the *only* way code can reach `main`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
